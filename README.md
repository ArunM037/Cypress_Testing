## Introduction

This repository houses automated tests written in Cypress for web applications. Cypress is a modern JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework that enables developers to write clear and reliable tests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version >= 12.0)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone "https://github.com/ArunM037/Cypress_Testing.git"
   cd Cypress_Testing
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

   or

   \`\`\`bash
   yarn install
   \`\`\`

## Folder Structure

- **\`cypress/\`**: Contains Cypress-specific files and folders.
  - **\`fixtures/\`**: Static data for tests (optional).
  - **\`integration/\`**: Test files go here.
  - **\`plugins/\`**: Cypress plugins (optional).
  - **\`support/\`**: Custom commands and reusable utilities.

## Writing Tests

Tests are written using Mocha and Chai syntax and are located in the \`cypress/integration\` folder. Cypress provides a robust set of commands for interacting with your application.

Example test (\`example.spec.js\`):

\`\`\`javascript
describe('Example Test Suite', () => {
  it('Visits the homepage', () => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.contains('Welcome to Cypress Automation').should('be.visible');
  });
});
\`\`\`

## Running Tests

To run tests in headless mode:

\`\`\`bash
npm run cy:run
\`\`\`

To open Cypress Test Runner:

\`\`\`bash
npm run cy:open
\`\`\`

## CI/CD Integration

Integrate Cypress tests into your CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on every push. Example configuration for GitHub Actions:

\`\`\`yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npm run cy:run -- --headless --browser chrome
\`\`\`
